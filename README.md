# reinforcement_learning
Summer project under programming club

Q)What is  the project?   
In this project, we will use reinforcement learning to train a computer program to play Snake. Snake is a popular game - you mustâ€™ve played it - found on old Nokia phones, which is based on the idea of a snake which grows if you feed it,  and dies if you collide with the wall or touch your tail.
